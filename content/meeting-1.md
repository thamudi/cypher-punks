# Cypherpunk

- A cypherpunk is any individual advocating widespread use of strong cryptography and privacy-enhancing technologies as a route to social and political change. Originally communicating through the Cypherpunks electronic mailing list, informal groups aimed to achieve privacy and security through proactive use of cryptography. Cypherpunks have been engaged in an active movement since the late 1980s. [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk)


# Baby Steps

- Our vision as cypherpunks starts with privacy. We live in a day and age where privacy is a joke and survilance is on the rise. As a cypherpunk yourself you should start using VPN to encrypt your connection, and as well as changing your default ISP DNS. Here's an [article](https://www.howtogeek.com/664608/why-you-shouldnt-be-using-your-isps-default-dns-server/) about why you shouldn't use your ISP default DNS.

- Also, while you are at it, do yourself a favor and start using brave instead of chrome. Here's another [article](https://medium.com/dataseries/brave-browser-why-should-you-start-using-it-57e8dd0b66a5) why you should concider using brave. 


# Raspberry pi Projekt

- One of the projects we would like to create is a Raspberry pi home server that would act as a server node. I've created a [playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrV21uQ4g88GlF7ZFF0upr1FtBboNmfiZ) that I will continuously update as I find more ideas to visualize what we have in mind, and as well easy tutorial for anyone to be able to create their own raspberry pi server.

 
# 2600 The Hackers Quarterly

- An interesting magazine that has a range of technical articles including and not limited to hacking. Here's the [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2600:_The_Hacker_Quarterly) to it. You can get a Digital copy of the book from their [website](https://www.2600.com/).
